## SFW -- Chrome extension

A simple browser extension that opens a new browser window with preconfigured safe-for-work URLs. No one likes shoulder surfers!

### Purpose

- learn how to create browser extensions

### To-dos

- right now Chrome-only; make available to other browsers
- style and create icon that isn't hideous

### To install (Chrome)

1. Download/clone repository.
2. Open [Chrome extensions manager](chrome://extensions/) and enable Developer Mode by clicking the slider in the top-right corner.
3. Select "Load unpacked" and navigate to directory containing repo and select folder.

This extension is for practice only. Don't blame me if something goes wrong. Personally I use [Brave](https://brave.com) rather than Chrome.
